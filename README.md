# Stuart's dotfiles

My configuration for various dotfiles, i.e. files that appear hidden (start with a '.' such as `.bashrc`) in my profile home directory. This helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work with macOS, but I use some of these dotfiles on various linux servers, and they seem to be pretty flexible.
